Product Launch Platforms Directory

A curated directory of product launch platforms, communities, and distribution channels for founders, indie makers, and marketers.

This repository serves as a single reference point for anyone launching a product, SaaS, app, tool, or side project and looking for the right places to share it. Instead of chasing hype, it helps you choose launch sources that actually match your product stage and goals.

Tier 1 – Must-Launch Platforms (High Signal, Real Traffic)

These are the heavy hitters. If you skip these, you’re leaving credibility and inbound on the table.
